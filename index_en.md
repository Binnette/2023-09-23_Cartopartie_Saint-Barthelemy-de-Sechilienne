## CMapathon report

On this day of 09/23/2023, we were very warmly welcomed by the town hall staff and of course the mayor: Gilles Strappazzon. The mayor provided us with invaluable help by pointing out all the remarkable places in the village as well as all the hidden gems: fountains, wash houses, water channels and even a remarkable cherry tree:

We were welcomed in one of the brand new rooms adjoining the new town hall. After a good coffee kindly offered by the town hall and pastries brought by Paul, we started to divide up certain areas to map. This is how Nicolas and I went to the place called Ruines, where we were able to visit the Chapel of Saint-François Régis:

On site, we of course used the excellent application [Every Door](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Every_Door) to add all the [POI](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/FR:Points_d%27int%C3%A9r%C3%AAt) found on site: hiking signs, recycling containers, etc. Here is an animation centered on the Ruines neighborhood before/after the mapathon:

Subsequently, we dispatched a small car expedition in the town of Séchilienne. Objective, to map a bit of the area and go collect pizzas graciously offered by the association [OpenStreetMap France](https://www.openstreetmap.fr/). We were 5 walking through the streets of Séchiliennes, phone in hand to heat up [Every Door](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Every_Door), [StreetComplete](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/StreetComplete) and [Vespucci](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Vespucci). We also recorded some GPS traces with [OsmAnd](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OsmAnd) to add a path between two neighborhoods of the city. Here is a comparison:

Subsequently, we drew this new path on [iD](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/ID) once back in Saint-Barthélemy-de-Séchilienne to restore us:

In the afternoon, I went back to explore Saint-Barthélemy with Nicolas, below are some photos of our adventures:

After, we navigated just about every corner of the village, phone in hand to add different POIs that came our way.

Many other gifs are available on my GitHub repo. I also had fun using different map renderings.

## A point on statistics

During this mapathon, 179 roads (of all kinds) were added, including 50 tracks and 96 alleys, most of which are private driveways to access the various houses in the village.

On the house number side (house number), we went from only 1 number listed to more than 94! A good step forward, but there is still work to be done.

Here are the detailed statistics that I generated via Osmosis:

Curious people can turn to my [cityStats.sh](stats/cityStats.sh) script in my GitHub repo.

Here is a graph produced by [ohsomeNow Stats](https://stats.now.ohsome.org/dashboard#hashtags=CartopartieSBDS&start=2023-07-27T00:00:00.000Z&end=2023-09-23T20:39:31.000Z&interval=P1D) showing our edits of the day, hour by hour for the hashtag #CartopartieSBDS:

Another graph with all the edits per day between July 27 and September 24:

We can see that a lot of work was done before D-Day. For my part, I mapped a lot thanks to aerial imagery to add as many visible elements as possible: buildings, roads, hedges, walls, etc. I thought this preliminary work would make our task on the field easier and could bring up more quests on StreetComplete once on site.

Speaking of StreetComplete, I count more than [84 changesets](https://osmcha.org/?filters=%7B%22editor%22%3A%5B%7B%22label%22%3A%22StreetComplete%22%2C%22value%22%3A%22StreetComplete%22%7D%5D%2C%22geometry%22%3A%5B%7B%22label%22%3A%7B%22coordinates%22%3A%5B%5B%5B5.797132%2C45.058885%5D%2C%5B5.797132%2C45.028651%5D%2C%5B5.851333%2C45.028651%5D%2C%5B5.851553%2C45.059195%5D%2C%5B5.797132%2C45.058885%5D%5D%5D%2C%22type%22%3A%22Polygon%22%7D%2C%22value%22%3A%7B%22coordinates%22%3A%5B%5B%5B5.797132%2C45.058885%5D%2C%5B5.797132%2C45.028651%5D%2C%5B5.851333%2C45.028651%5D%2C%5B5.851553%2C45.059195%5D%2C%5B5.797132%2C45.058885%5D%5D%5D%2C%22type%22%3A%22Polygon%22%7D%7D%5D%7D) made with StreetComplete. NB: StreetComplete does not allow (unless I'm mistaken) to add a hashtag to our contributions, so we will have to add these 84 changesets to our total.

The site [resultmaps](https://resultmaps.neis-one.org/osm-changesets?comment=CartopartieSBDS#12/45.0373/5.8125) provides nice stats about the hashtag #CartopartieSBDS but only for the last 30 days. Here is the map of changesets traced by this tool:

Graph of the number of changeset in pink (left y-axis) and the number of contributors (right y-axis):

![Changesets and contributors](changesets/ChangesetsAndContributors.png)

Here is the information displayed by this tool for the tag #CartopartieSBDS:
- Number of OSM Contributors: 5
- Number of Map Changes: 6,214
- Total number of Changesets: 210

Number of created (modified) (deleted) OSM Objects
- Nodes: 3,855 (1,068) (297)
- Ways: 495 (483) (13)
- Highways: 230 (183)
- Buildings: 46
- Land-uses: 23
- Waterways: 7

We can see that this mapathon was particularly productive. With more than 6,214 map modifications! A very good score! Especially since we would have to add the modifications made by StreetComplete.

## Conclusion
